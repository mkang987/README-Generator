# README-Generator

## Description

This application was created to help reduce the time to create a professional README.
This project will help everyone that is starting a new career in programing have a base foundation on how a README should look like.
I learned that creating a README when starting out can be confusing on what type of information is needed and the formatting.

## Installation

-Must have NODE installed on computer
-Run an npm install on integrated terminal.

## Usage
-To use, run node index.js in the terminal
